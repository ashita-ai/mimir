### River Tables

River manages its own tables (`river_job`, `river_leader`, `river_queue`, etc.) via its built-in migrator. Do not create or modify these manually. River's migration runs at startup:

```go
migrator, _ := rivermigrate.New(riverpgxv5.New(pool), nil)
migrator.Migrate(ctx, rivermigrate.DirectionUp, nil)
```

## StoreAdapter Implementation

```go
type PostgresStore struct {
    pool    *pgxpool.Pool
    queries *generated.Queries
}

func NewPostgresStore(pool *pgxpool.Pool) *PostgresStore {
    return &PostgresStore{
        pool:    pool,
        queries: generated.New(pool),
    }
}
```

### Transaction Support

Operations that must be atomic (e.g., webhook receive: upsert PR + enqueue River job) require a transaction-bound store. The callback receives both a `StoreAdapter` that executes queries on the transaction and the raw `pgx.Tx` for River's `InsertTx`:

```go
func (s *PostgresStore) WithTx(ctx context.Context, fn func(txStore adapter.StoreAdapter, tx pgx.Tx) error) error {
    tx, err := s.pool.Begin(ctx)
    if err != nil {
        return fmt.Errorf("begin tx: %w", err)
    }
    defer tx.Rollback(ctx)

    // Construct a store bound to the transaction, not the pool.
    // All queries executed through txStore run on the same transaction.
    txStore := &PostgresStore{
        pool:    s.pool,           // kept for reference, but queries use tx
        queries: generated.New(tx), // sqlc accepts pgx.Tx (implements DBTX)
    }

    if err := fn(txStore, tx); err != nil {
        return err
    }
    return tx.Commit(ctx)
}
```

River's `InsertTx` method accepts the raw `pgx.Tx`, ensuring job enqueue is atomic with PR persistence. The `txStore` ensures all store operations within the callback participate in the same transaction.

---

## Connection Pool Configuration

```go
poolConfig, _ := pgxpool.ParseConfig(cfg.DatabaseURL)
poolConfig.MaxConns = 20                          // default; tune per instance
poolConfig.MinConns = 2
poolConfig.HealthCheckPeriod = 30 * time.Second
poolConfig.MaxConnLifetime = 30 * time.Minute
poolConfig.MaxConnIdleTime = 5 * time.Minute
```

These defaults are for a single `mimir serve` instance. In multi-instance deployments, `MaxConns` should be lowered to avoid exhausting PostgreSQL's `max_connections`. Document this in the config spec.

---

## Data Durability & Operational Requirements

### Backup Strategy

Production deployments **must** run PostgreSQL with:

1. **`synchronous_commit = on` (the default).** Do not disable this. Mimir's durability model depends on committed transactions surviving a crash. With `synchronous_commit = off`, a crash between commit acknowledgment and WAL flush silently loses the transaction — including webhook-enqueued jobs and persisted findings. This is a hard requirement for "no data loss."
2. **WAL archiving enabled.** Continuous archiving to object storage (S3, GCS, or equivalent). This enables point-in-time recovery (PITR) to any second within the retention window.
3. **Periodic base backups.** At least daily via `pg_basebackup` or equivalent. Base backups + WAL archive = full PITR capability.
4. **Retention period.** Minimum 30 days of WAL archives. Findings are long-lived audit data; the retention period should match your compliance requirements.

These are PostgreSQL operational requirements, not Mimir application requirements. Mimir does not implement its own backup logic. At startup, `mimir serve` logs a warning if it detects `synchronous_commit = off` via `SHOW synchronous_commit`.

### Deletion Policy

All foreign keys use `ON DELETE RESTRICT`. Deleting a `pull_requests` row fails if any `review_tasks`, `findings`, or `pipeline_runs` reference it. This is intentional — audit data is never silently destroyed.

To remove old data:

1. **Soft delete** the `pull_requests` row (`SoftDeletePullRequest` query sets `deleted_at`). All downstream data remains intact but the PR is excluded from active queries.
2. For hard deletion (e.g., GDPR compliance), delete in reverse dependency order: `finding_events` → `findings` → `review_tasks` → `pipeline_runs` → `pull_requests`. This must be an explicit, deliberate operation — never automated without review.

### No Cascade, No Silent Loss

The `ON DELETE RESTRICT` constraint on every FK is a guardrail against accidental data loss. If a migration, admin script, or future cleanup job attempts to delete a parent row with children, PostgreSQL will reject the operation with a clear error. This is the correct failure mode for audit-critical data.
